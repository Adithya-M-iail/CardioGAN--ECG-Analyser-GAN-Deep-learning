# CardioGAN--ECG-Analyser-GAN-Deep-learning
 This project uses a deepfake-ecg model from Pulse2Pulse GAN to generate realistic deepfake ECG images and a CNN-based classifier to categorize ECGs as Normal, Abnormal, or indicative of Myocardial Infarction (MI). The web interface, built with Flask and HTML, allows users to upload ECG images, analyze them, and get instant classification results.
